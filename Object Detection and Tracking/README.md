# Object Detections Using Yolo

![Design preview for the Pricing component with toggle coding challenge](groupFriendsBeforeDetection.JPEG)

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of Yolov3 Algorithm and CV2 Module.**

## The challenge

My challenge is to Write a Code to detect objects in the Given image .

With the help of using Yolov3 Algorithm we can complete this Challenge.

In Yolov3 algorithm we are having a CFG Folder in that Folder we have:

- Yolov3-tiny.cfg
- Yolove.cfg

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
3. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
4. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
5. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
